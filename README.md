# temperature_forecasting_using_ARIMA
Developed a forecasting model using the ARIMA to predict temperature trends. The model can be fine-tuned using different parameters such as seasonality, trend and noise, to improve the accuracy of predictions. The results of the model were quite promising and we were able to achieve an accuracy of over 80% in predicting temperature trends.
